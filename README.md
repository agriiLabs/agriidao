agriiDAO

agriiDAO is a decentralized platform aimed at transforming the global food system by digitizing and decentralizing African agricultural supply chains. Our mission is to create a zero-waste food system that enhances global food security through innovative practices, such as tokenizing real-world agricultural assets, reducing waste, and empowering communities with sustainable agricultural opportunities.
agriiDAO Ecosystem

The ecosystem comprises several key components:

    agriiProtocol: The core technology layer, providing a distributed ledger for data management and provenance.
    agriiPrice: A platform providing daily market prices for African fruits and vegetables, ensuring transparency and up-to-date information.
    agriiTrace: Tracks the provenance of agricultural products from farm to market, enabling transparency and trust in the supply chain.
    agriiCOOP: The cooperative framework that allows members to fund projects, vote on initiatives, and share in rewards through community-driven participation.
    agriiMarket: An on-chain marketplace for trading tokenized agricultural assets, expanding access to new financial opportunities.

Current Status

    agriiProtocol v1: Deployed to the ICP mainnet, establishing the foundation for the ecosystem.
    agriiPrice: Currently in development, set to provide daily market prices for African fruits and vegetables.
