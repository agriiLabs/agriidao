# agriiDAO

**agriiDAO** is a decentralized platform aimed at transforming the global food system by digitizing and decentralizing African agricultural supply chains. Our mission is to create a zero-waste food system that enhances global food security through innovative practices, such as tokenizing real-world agricultural assets, reducing waste, and empowering communities with sustainable agricultural opportunities.

## agriiDAO Ecosystem

The ecosystem comprises several key components:

1. **agriiProtocol**: The core technology layer, providing a distributed ledger for data management and provenance.
2. **agriiPrice**: A platform providing daily market prices for African fruits and vegetables, ensuring transparency and up-to-date information.
3. **agriiTrace**: Tracks the provenance of agricultural products from farm to market, enabling transparency and trust in the supply chain.
4. **agriiCOOP**: The cooperative framework that allows members to fund projects, vote on initiatives, and share in rewards through community-driven participation.
5. **agriiMarket**: An on-chain marketplace for trading tokenized agricultural assets, expanding access to new financial opportunities.

## Current Status

- **agriiProtocol v1**: Deployed to the ICP mainnet, establishing the foundation for the ecosystem.
- **agriiPrice**: Currently in development, set to provide daily market prices for African fruits and vegetables.
